This project focuses on real-time object detection in computer vision, employing a pre-trained deep learning model, MobileNet, for efficiency on embedded systems. By capturing webcam images and processing them in real-time, the algorithm detects objects in a video stream, making it a promising solution for accurate and efficient object recognition in various applications.
In simple terms, the implementation of object detection using MobileNet SSD involves the following steps:
Open the real-time webcam.
Extract frames from the video.
For each frame in the video:
a. Preprocess the frame by resizing it to the required input size and subtracting the mean and scaling the values.
b. Pass the preprocessed frame through the MobileNet SSD model to obtain a set of predictions for objects in the frame.
c. Filter out the predictions with low confidence scores.
d. Draw the final set of bounding boxes on the frame.
Display the processed frame with the bounding boxes and accuracy overlaid on top.
These steps outline the basic process of implementing object detection using the MobileNet SSD model on a real-time video feed.
